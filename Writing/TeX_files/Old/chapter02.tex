\subsection{Reconstruction and criticism of previous models}
\subsubsection{Shaggy's multidimensional model}
Lack of both quantative evidence and sociological theory to support interplay of formal and informal networks as major role in revolution. Also does not take into account fact that friendships are not random and occur more between people of the same class.\\
\subsubsection{Epstein's spatial agent-based model}
Spatial interactions are decreasingly important in modern revolutions. Useful in pre-technological revolutions but modern revolutions such as the Arab Spring were due in large part to non-spatial interactions.
